# plant-shop-flutter

This project is part of a coding challenge sponsored by the heyFlutter YouTube channel. The objective is to replicate the user interface showcased in a Dribbble design, which you can view [here](https://dribbble.com/shots/16340862-Plants-Shop-App-UI). It's worth mentioning that the challenge provided only a single image of the design, featuring three distinct pages. The image below represents the sole material given for this challenge.
